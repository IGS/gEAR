# Notes about the Docker setup

## Before building

* From the gEAR root, `cd docker`
* `cp gear.ini.docker.template gear.ini.docker`
  * Alternatively ask Shaun for a gear.ini.docker file as it will be filled in. Otherwise fill in any values wrapped in brackets
* `cp docker-compose.yml.template docker-compose.yml`
  * Alternatively ask Shaun for a docker-compose.yml file as it will be filled in. Otherwise fill in any values wrapped in brackets
  * Shaun's file is hard-coded to his paths so be sure to change those.

## Building

* Ensure you are in the "devel" branch of gEAR before building (`git checkout devel`)
* To build run `docker build -t umgear:main .`
  * If you tag it under a new image, ensure it is reflected in the docker-compose.yml file

## ProjectR

Currently the gear.ini.docker file is configured to send projectR jobs to the cloud, but to not use RabbitMQ.  This is to save me the hassle of managing an extra service.  What this means is that apache process will manage the jobs and job logging will write to /var/log/apache2/ssl_umgear_error.log in the container.

## "panel" service

You can pre-build the "panel_app" image using the Dockerfile from `<gear_root>/services/spatial/Dockerfile`

## Annotations and Datasets

* Annotation and dataset files to use need to be housed on the host machine initially since they are not contained in the gEAR codebase and thus will not be available in the Dockerized version of gEAR out of the box
* Right now the only annotation I am including is Mouse - release 94.  This is because each annotation directory is about 1Gb each and would overrun the storage on my computer and blow up the size of the 'dataset' Docker image if all were added.  We only need one annotation for sandboxing and development though.
* I am also using the Hertzano/Ament P2 mouse cochlea dataset for testing (as recommended by Brian Herb)

### Loading annotation data

* After launching the Docker containers via docker-compose, the annotation data may not be loaded into the MySQL database.  To do this (substitute species and release number as needed):

1. Run `docker-compose exec web /bin/bash`
2. `cd /opt/gEAR/annotations/mouse`
3. Run `../../bin/load_genbank_annotations.py -i ./release-94 -id 1 -r 94` which will load the annotation file

## Getting datasets

Generally, for development purposes, it is best to just have datasets for a couple of dataset collections, such as "Hearing (site default)" and "Ear (diverse variety)"

The following dataset IDs are representative of both of the aforementioned dataset collections:

```text
7812a487-932b-32f7-2de7-33dd3155c849
c69485b2-6f8d-c60e-7337-e7ebad89b2c0

e78db16a-3927-348c-f5aa-4256330a7dff
```

You can write some script to loop through these IDs and download them to your "datasets" directory. If your docker-compose.yml file mounting is configured correctly then you can do this outside of the container

`cd <gear_root>/www/datasets`
`wget https://umgear.org/datasets/<dataset_id>.h5ad .`

## MySQL

* See mysql_setup_notes.md for more information.  Shaun has a dump file you can use.  However do note that if there is a dataset or weighted gene list entry in the db and you do not have the physical file, then you may have errors.

## Running the docker container

The docker-compose.yml file is set up to mount the gEAR code as a volume, allowing you to make immediate edits to be reflected inside the container.  If making changes within `<gear_root>/www/api`, they will apply once you run `docker compose restart web`.

At any time you can run `docker compose exec web tail -f /var/log/apache2/ssl_umgear_error.log` to view a running error log.

## Issues and potential solutions

* I cannot log in
  * Clear your browser's cache
  * Use the email address in the 'username' place.  I'm an idiot and always forget that.
