to Ensembl 
Hi Joshua

If you are referring to our ensembl_id field in the object_xref table then it's any one of a number of fields. Ensembl id refers to the primary key from

- gene
- transcript
- translation
- operon
- operon_transcript

The ensembl_object_type indicates the source of the identifier e.g. An object type of Gene means ensembl_id is equivalent to gene_id in the gene table.

I will urge a lot of caution of using the SQL schema directly. The relations are not the easiest to follow and we can make large changes. However if you want a lot of different types of annotation data linked to the central objects (especially genes and variants) have you taken a look at biomart our data warehouse tool? You can access the tool from http://www.ensembl.org/biomart and a video from http://www.ensembl.org/Multi/Help/Movie?db=core;id=189

Hope this helps you get to the data you need quickly

Best regards

Andy
