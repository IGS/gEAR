      <h3>About gEAR</h3>
      <p>
        The gEAR portal is a website for visualization and analysis of multiomic data both in
        public and private domains. The gEAR also enables upload, visualization and analysis
        of scRNA-seq data. For detailed instructions on how to use the portal please refer to
        the gEAR Manual. The gEAR is maintained by a team at the University of Maryland School
        of Medicine, and led by Dr. Ronna Hertzano and Joshua Orvis. The gEAR is supported by
        the NIDCD/NIH R01DC013817, R01DC019370, NIMH/NIH R24MH114815 and the Hearing Health Foundation (Hearing Restoration Project).

      <h3>Looking for the legacy/original version of the gEAR?</h3>
      <p>
        While no longer maintained, the original form of the gEAR (not suitable for larger datasets)
        is still available <a href='https://legacy.umgear.org/'>here</a>.  All public datasets have been converted to the current gEAR, but
        if you have private datasets left behind please <a href='./contact.html'>let us know</a> and we will convert them.
