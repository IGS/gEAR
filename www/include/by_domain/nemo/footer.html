      <h3>About NeMO</h3>
      <p>
        The Neuroscience Multi-Omic (NeMO) Analytics portal enables web-based visualization and
        analysis of multi-omic data describing cell types in the developing and adult brain,
        powered by <a href='https://umgear.org'>gEAR</a> and
        <a href='https://epiviz.github.io/' alt='EpiViz'>EpiViz</a>.. Release 1 (April 2019)
        includes single-cell and bulk tissue RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and ChIP-seq from the fetal human
        prefrontal cortex, as well as from stem cell models of neural induction. The portal will
        expand to include multiple regions of the developing and adult brain and additional
        analytical tools.
