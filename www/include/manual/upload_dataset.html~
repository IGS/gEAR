  <h2>Upload New Dataset</h2>
  <p>
    General introduction words.
  </p>
  <h2>Dataset upload instructions</h2>
  <p>
    Each dataset uploaded requires two things:  an SVG file which graphically represents your
    expression data and a tab-delimited text data file with the actual values.  The two are linked
    by agreement between the column header in the data file and class attributes in the SVG file's
    path elements, as illustrated below.
  </p>
  <ol id="steps_overview">
    <li>
      <span>Data file</span>: This holds your expression data, and should have at least a 'Gene symbol'
      column and then expression value columns, with headers on the first row.  Currently only
      tab-delimited text files are supported.
    </li>
    <li>
     <span>SVG file</span>: Graphical representation of your data to be colorized based on expression
      value.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Data file</h3>
  <div class="instructions_image_c">
    <img src="img/upload_help_spreadsheet.png" alt="File upload - Spreadsheet"/>
  </div>
  <p>
    This file must at least have a column labeled 'Gene_symbol', then any number of data columns
    with expression values.  This will be linked to your SVG using the values in the header row.  Here,
    for example, column D has data for 'Hair_cells', and you'll see this matches exactly the class values
    in the SVG files (below).
  </p>
  <h3>SVG file</h3>
  <div class="instructions_image_c">
    <img src="img/upload_help_svg.png" alt="File upload - SVG graphic view"/>
  </div>
  <p>
    SVG files can be created with tools such as <a href='https://inkscape.org'>Inkscape</a> (free)
    or <a href='http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html'>Adobe Illustrator</a> (commercial).
    They are really just plain text files which represent drawings like the one above, but which look
    like the file below:
  </p>
  <div class="instructions_image_c">
    <img src="img/upload_help_svg_text.png" alt="File upload - Spreadsheet text"/>
  </div>
  <p>
    Each &lt;path&gt; element there represents a line or shape in the image, and the 'class' value
    on each lets us connect that shape to the expression value in your data file.  Here, the 'class'
    value for this path element is 'Hair_cells', which matches column D in our spreadsheet exactly.  As
    long as you have agreement between the data columns and your SVG classes, the interface will
    display your expression values properly.

  <h3>Describe Data</h3>
  <p>
  	Finally, provide some details to describe the data. 
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Title</b> - A concise description of the dataset. For example:
      <p>"P0, mouse cochlea, RNA-seq, Hair cells compared with rest of cochlear duct."</p>
    </li>
    <li><b>Organism</b> - Select the organism used in the data (Mouse, Chick, Zebrafish)</li>
    <li><b>PubMed ID</b> - Provide the PubMed ID, if the data is published.</li>
    <li>
      <b>Access Level</b> - Select "Public" to make the dataset viewable to all gEAR users, 
      or select "Private" to keep the dataset viewable only to you, and others you have shared 
      it with (if applicable).
    </li>
    <li><b>Publication Preview</b> - </li> <!-- TODO-->
    <li>
      <b>Long Description</b> - An expanded description of the dataset. For example:
      <p>
        "(P0) Atoh1<sup>A1GFP/A1GFP</sup> mice which express GFP in their hair cells were used. 
        Cochlear ducts were dissociated and hair cells were separated from the rest of the cells 
        in the cochlear duct. Gene expression was measured using RNA-seq. (Cai T, Jen HI, Kang H, 
        Klisch TJ, Zoghbi HY and Groves AK (2015) Characterization of the transcriptome of nascent 
        hair cells and identification of direct targets of the Atoh1 transcription factor.
