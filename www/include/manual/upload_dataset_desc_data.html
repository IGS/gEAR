  <h2>Step 2: Describe Data</h2>
  <p>
    In this step, you can provide some details to describe your data. The following
    image shows where to complete this step.

  </div>
  <br />
  <ul id="dataset_desc_info">
    <li><b>Title</b> - A concise description of the dataset. For example:
      <p>"P0, mouse cochlea, RNA-seq, Hair cells compared with rest of cochlear duct."</p>
    </li>
    <li><b>Organism</b> - Select the organism used in the data (Mouse, Chick, Zebrafish)</li>
    <li><b>PubMed ID</b> - Provide the PubMed ID, if the data is published. (Optional)</li>
    <li><b>GEO ID</b> - Provide the GEO ID, the GSE number is preferred. (Optional)</li>
    <li>
      <b>Access Level</b> - Select "Public" to make the dataset viewable to all gEAR users,
      or select "Private" to keep the dataset viewable only to you, and others you have shared
      it with (if applicable).
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Tags</b> - Think of these as the hashtags used in social media, but no preceeding
      '#' required. Tags allow diseases, conditions, tissues, and topics to be assigned a
      dataset. These are searchable, so searching for a particular tag in the Dataset Manager
      will return any dataset that has that tag assigned to it. Here are some examples:
      <p>
        "Huntington, Huntington-disease, HuntingtonDisease"
      </p>
    </li>
    <li><b>Publication Preview</b> - Manuscript title will appear here after PMID is entered.</li>
    <li><b>GEO Preview</b> - GEO title will appear here after GEO ID is entered.</li>
    <li>
      <b>Long Description</b> - An expanded description of the dataset. For example:
      <p>
        "(P0) Atoh1<sup>A1GFP/A1GFP</sup> mice which express GFP in their hair cells were used.
        Cochlear ducts were dissociated and hair cells were separated from the rest of the cells
        in the cochlear duct. Gene expression was measured using RNA-seq. (Cai T, Jen HI, Kang H,
        Klisch TJ, Zoghbi HY and Groves AK (2015) Characterization of the transcriptome of nascent
        hair cells and identification of direct targets of the Atoh1 transcription factor.
        J Neurosci. 2015 Apr 8;35(14):5870-83)"
