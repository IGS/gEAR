  <h2>Line graph format</h2>
  <p>
    To upload a dataset as a line graph, gEAR requires only a tab-delimited text data file. This
    file holds your expression data, and should have a 'Gene symbol' column and then expression
    value columns, with headers on the first row.
  </p>
  <h3>Data file</h3>
  <div class="manual_section">
    <p>
      This file must have a column labeled 'Gene symbol' containing your genes of interest.
      The following data columns contain the expression values. These columns must be labeled using
      the following convention: <span><b>Group--Label</b></span>. A <b>Group</b> can be considered
      your experimental groups, while a <b>label</b> can be considered a replicate. To use multiple
      words within a <b>group</b> or <b>label</b>, use an underscore ('_') instead of a space.
    </p>
    <p>
      To include <b>p-values</b> and <b>standard deviations</b>, you use the exact name for the
      p-value and stand deviation columns as used for their the corresponding expression column
      and append '_pval' or '_sd'. For example, the p-value and stand deviation columns for column
      'Untreated--0' would be 'Untreated--0_pval' and 'Untreated--0_sd', respectively.
       See below for an example.

    <p>
      The spreadsheet above can yield the line graphs (below). Depending on how the columns are
      arranged on the dataset uploader, you can display the dataset as a series of subplots (max
      of 3 subplots) or display the dataset as a single graph, with 1 or more series. On the left,
      you'll notice the 'Group' parts of the column headers label each subplot. This is automatically
      handled by the dataset uploader. On the right, you'll see that 'Untreated' and 'Treated' are
      plotted together. Multi-series plots like this must be uploaded as a single plot. Subplots
      are too small that contain multiple series, therefore we do not allow it. When you hover the
      mouse of a line, the 'Label' for the line and expression value display.

    Once your file is formatted and uploaded, you'll be ready to complete the next step.
