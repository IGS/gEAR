  <h2>SVG format</h2>
  <p>
    To upload a dataset as an SVG, gEAR requires two files:  a spreadsheet data file
    and an SVG file.  The two are linked by agreement between the column header in the data file and class
    attributes in the SVG file's path elements, as illustrated below.
  </p>
  <ol id="steps_overview">
    <li>
      <span><b>Data file</b></span>: This holds your expression data, and should have at least a 'Gene symbol'
      column and then expression value columns, with headers on the first row.  This file can be in any of the
      following formats:  .xlsx, .xls, .obs, comma-delimited (.csv) or tab-delimited (.tab).
    </li>
    <li>
     <span><b>SVG file</b></span>: Graphical representation of your data to be colorized based on expression
      values.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Data file</h3>
  <div class="manual_section">
    <p>
      This file must at least have a column labeled 'Gene_symbol', then any number of data columns
      with expression values.  This will be linked to your SVG using the values in the header row.  Below,
      for example, column D has data for 'Hair_cells', and you'll see this matches exactly the class values
      in the SVG files.

  <h3>SVG file</h3>
  <div class="manual_section">
    <p>
      SVG files can be created with tools such as <a href="https://inkscape.org" target="_blank">Inkscape</a> (free)
      or <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html" target="_blank">Adobe Illustrator</a> (commercial).
      As you will see, an SVG is really just a plain text file which represents a drawing. This file contains
      &lt;path&gt; elements which represent lines or shapes in the image. Each &lt;path&gt; element has a 'class'
      value that lets gEAR connect that shape to the expression value in your data file.
    </p>
    <p>
      Below is an example of an SVG. This example, being viewed with Inkscape, has a &lt;path&gt; element selected.
      The &lt;path&gt; element has the 'class' attribute with the value 'Hair_cells'. This 'class' value corresponds to the column D in our
      spreadsheet exactly. To assign a data column of the spreadsheet to an &lt;path&gt; element of the SVG, the 'class' attribute
      must match the column header. As long as you have agreement between the data columns and your SVG classes, the
      interface will display your expression values properly.

    </div>
    <br />
    <p>
      Below is a text view of the SVG file from above. You'll see each &lt;path&gt; element has the 'class' value of
      'Hair_cells' which matches the header of column D in our spreadsheet.
