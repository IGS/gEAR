              <p>gEAR is a tool for managing your gear.  It's a place to keep track of what you have, where it is, 
                and what condition it's in.  It's a place to keep track of what you want, what you need, and what 
                you've sold.  It's a place to keep track of what you've lent out, what you've borrowed, and what 
                you've lost.  It's a place to keep track of what you've used, what you've loved, and what you've 
                hated.  It's a place to keep track of what you've fixed, what you've broken, and what you've 
                replaced.  It's a place to keep track of what you've bought, what you've sold, and what you've 
                traded.  It's a place to keep track of what you've made, what you've modified, and what you've 
                estroyed.  It's a place to keep track of what you've researched, what you've learned, and what 
                you've forgotten.  It's a place to keep track of what you've planned, what you've done, and 
                what you've dreamed.  It's a place to keep track of what you've shared, what you've kept 
                secret, and what you've lost track of.</p>
